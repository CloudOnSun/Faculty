# C# Assignments

These are the assignments I had to do while learning C# in Erasmus.

The Final Project directory cotains a big semster project which I had to do to get the credits for the course. 

The Expression Evaluation 2&3 cotains a project which evaluates a arithmetic expression in preorder notation. It is very OOP written and uses Visitor design pattern
