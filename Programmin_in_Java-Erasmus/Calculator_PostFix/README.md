# Calculator

The goal is to implement a simple calculator that reads the input in the postfix notation.

The input is read from the standard input. The results are printed out to the standard output. The calculator supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The calculator supports numbers of the type int. The results are also of the type int, i.e., use integer division.

The input expressions are separated by end-of-line. The numbers and operators are separated by at least one whitespace (except for end-of-line). After the whole expression is read, the result is immediately printed out. If the input expression contains an error (not enough operands for an operator, not enough operators for operands, an unknown operator, incorrectly formatted number, invalid operation, ...), the program prints out Malformed expression. An empty line (or a line containing only whitespaces) is not an error and is ignored. In the case of division by zero, the program prints out Zero division.

The program ends with the end of the input.
