# Description
This directory cotains all the assigments done during my Erasmus+ mobility in Prague, at Charles University, taking the course AI 1 NAIL069 by professor Roman Barták PhD.
All the games were implemented by the faculty and all the credits go to them. For every game, my contributions were the Agent class and the AI search algorithm.
The following parts are from the initial README

# AI I
This repository contains practical tasks for the [Artificial Intelligence 1](http://ktiml.mff.cuni.cz/~bartak/ui/) course, that is based on book by Russel and Norvig [Artificial Intellignece: A Modern Approach, 4th Edition](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Russell-Artificial-Intelligence-A-Modern-Approach-4th-Edition/PGM1263338.html). Tasks are designed to review AI algorithms and use them to play games.

## Requirements
All assignments will be written in python. Task were created for python 3.9 however there should not be any problems with backward compatibility. You can solve all assignments while working exclusively with python standard library, however for game visualizations you will need to install modul [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted).
For installation you can use [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

    python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user

If you need more detailed, platform-specific instructions you can visit [pygame-GettingStarted](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted).
